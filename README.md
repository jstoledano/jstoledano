# Javier Sanchez Toledano

Senior Backend Engineer focused on long-lived systems.

I design, build, and operate backend software that has to remain reliable over many years, often in regulated and resource-constrained environments. My work sits at the intersection of backend engineering, systems reliability, and real-world process modeling.

I care about clarity over novelty, explicit models over hidden magic, and software that people actually use without friction.

### What I work on

- Backend systems that act as a **single source of truth**
- Process-driven software (workflows, roles, traceability, auditability)
- Long-running production systems with low operational cost
- Conservative, maintainable architectures over trend-driven designs

Most of my professional work has been in environments where systems cannot be rewritten every two years and failure has real consequences.

### Technical focus

- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, Django  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, SQL (data validation, reporting, traceability)  
- **Systems:** Linux, production operations, system reliability  
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Nginx  
- **Architecture:** Process modeling, modular monoliths, long-lived system design

I deliberately avoid over-claiming experience in areas I haven’t operated at scale in production.

### Background

- Senior Backend / Systems Engineer in government-regulated environments  
- Experience supporting ISO 9001 quality management systems  
- Former ISO 9001 Lead Auditor (IRCA)  
- Comfortable working close to real users, auditors, and operational staff

### On GitHub

Here you’ll find:
- Backend projects focused on clarity and maintainability  
- Experiments and tools extracted from real operational needs  
- Documentation-first approaches to system design  

Not everything here is polished or trendy. Most of it is honest.
